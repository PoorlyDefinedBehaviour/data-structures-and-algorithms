/*
A string is a valid parentheses string (denoted VPS) if it meets one of the following:

    It is an empty string "", or a single character not equal to "(" or ")",
    It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are VPS's, or
    It can be written as (A), where A is a VPS.

We can similarly define the nesting depth depth(S) of any VPS S as follows:

    depth("") = 0
    depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B)), where A and B are VPS's
    depth("(" + A + ")") = 1 + depth(A), where A is a VPS.

For example, "", "()()", and "()(()())" are VPS's (with nesting depths 0, 1, and 2), and ")(" and "(()" are not VPS's.

Given a VPS represented as string s, return the nesting depth of s.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "(1+(2*3)+((8)/4))+1"
Output: 3
Explanation: Digit 8 is inside of 3 nested parentheses in the string.
